A simple Password Manager built using React.js and Tailwind CSS.

This project allows users to securely store and manage their account details used across different websites.  
Users can:
• Add username, website URL, and password  
• Update saved entries  
• Delete entries  
• Copy details easily  

All data is stored locally using LocalStorage, making the app fully functional without any backend.  
(Currently using only LocalStorage, but MongoDB integration is planned for the next version.)

Tech Stack:
• React.js (Functional Components + Hooks)  
• Tailwind CSS  
• LocalStorage for CRUD operations

This project demonstrates my skills in component structure, state management, and clean, responsive UI design.
